## Cybersecurity Incident Response and Analysis

This repository provides hands-on implementation and analysis of common cyber threats, along with defensive configurations using industry-standard tools.

---

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to detect, prevent, and respond to various cybersecurity incidents using real-world tools like:

- **Wazuh** (SIEM & log analysis)
- **ModSecurity** (Web Application Firewall)
- **Snort** (Intrusion Detection System)
- **Hydra** (Brute-force attack tool)
- **MXToolBox** (Email spoofing analysis)
- **Fail2Ban** (SSH intrusion prevention)

Each tool is configured and tested against specific attack scenarios to evaluate their effectiveness in real-time incident response.

##  Tools Overview

| Tool         | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Wazuh**    | Open-source platform for log data analysis and threat detection.           |
| **ModSecurity** | Web Application Firewall to protect against OWASP Top 10 threats.       |
| **Snort**    | Network-based IDS for traffic monitoring and signature-based detection.     |
| **Hydra**    | Password-cracking tool for brute-force attacks on various protocols.        |
| **MXToolBox**| Online tool for email header and DNS analysis, useful for spoofing detection.|
| **Fail2Ban** | Monitors logs and bans IPs after malicious activity (e.g., failed SSH logins).|

##  Challenges & Learnings

Throughout this project, we:
- Gained practical knowledge of attack vectors like **SQLi**, **brute-force**, and **spoofing**
- Learned to implement and tune defensive tools
- Understood alerting mechanisms and traffic inspection
- Faced real-world issues in log parsing, rule conflicts, and IDS configuration

---

##  Conclusion

This project emphasizes the importance of layered security. From web firewalls to log analyzers and IDS systems, every layer adds crucial protection against modern cyber threats.

Cybersecurity is not just about toolsâ€”it's about how we **configure**, **monitor**, and **respond** to threats proactively.
